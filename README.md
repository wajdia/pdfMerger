You can have a ton of websites that merges your pdf files
All of them request to upload your files to their servers
There is a privacy issue in this
pdfMerger allows to merge pdf files directly from the browser
No need to upload files to someone server
No need to wait if you have a poor internet upload speed
The browser does the work directly using JS
